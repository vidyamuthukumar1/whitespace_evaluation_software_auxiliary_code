Auxiliary code for Whitespace Evaluation SofTware (WEST)
-------------------------------------------------------

This code was written as a supplement to WEST, a code based designed and developed by Kate Harrison, graduate student in EECS at UC Berkeley. WEST is a robust and versatile tool that makes it easy to evaluate [whitespace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_spaces_%28radio%29) opportunities with different regulatory sets and for a wide variety of geographies. It can be used to make color-coded maps showing the amount of available whitespace, as well as evaluate various other statistical metrics.

Some of the defining features of this code base include a faster core algorithm to evaluate available whitespace over a particular geographic region using a particular regulatory set, algorithms to plot various statistical metrics, and auxiliary tests.

This code is used to evaluate whitespace specifically over the US in scenarios before and after the FCC's [incentive auction](http://www.fcc.gov/incentiveauctions). It is also used to compare whitespace evaluation for various regulatory sets over the US and Canada. This code base will continue to be augmented with implementations of versatile regulatory sets, evaluation of whitespace over a variety of geographical regions, and new statistical metrics for quantifying the available whitespace opportunity worldwide.
